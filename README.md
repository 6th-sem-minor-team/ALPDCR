## Abstract

## Its recommended that you install all the packages directly from the requirments.txt file.
Also its a good practice to make a new environment for this project
firstly install <ins>[ananconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)</ins>That gets you the Conda package and environment manager, which just makes life more pleasant, in our experience, and allows us to do this:

```bash
conda create -n shiny_new_env python=3.8
```
then to activate it

```bash
 conda activate shiny_new_env
```
lastly once inside your new environmrnt run the following line to get all the packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
